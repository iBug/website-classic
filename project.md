### [OJSandbox](https://github.com/taoky/OJSandbox)
An experimental sandbox for online judgers (OJ). I am a co-author.

### [(Charcoal) Smoke Detector](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector)
A community-driven chatbot that detects spam across the Stack Exchange Network and reports them, so they can be quickly removed.

I joined the team in December 2017, and [was recognized as a developer](/p/3) in March 2018.

This is the largest project in this page and also the first existing project that I've joined (all other projects are started from scratch).

### [Tetris with AI](/TetrisAI)
A good game automation that you *must* try and watch!

### [SpaceRider](/SpaceRider)
An old Flash plane-shooting game that I made when I was 13. ActionScript 2.0 (so expect that it won't run very fluently on a low-end computer)

### [Python Reversi](/PyReversi)
An implementation of the classic Reversi / Othello game using Python and PyQt5. It has an intensive AI that's hard to beat.

### [Human Resource Machine Programming Language](/HRM)

### [Aurora Theme](/aurora-theme)
Aurora is a clean, responsive Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

And it's the theme for my Project Pages. I have published this theme [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/aurora-theme).

### [College Physics Experiments Toolbox](/CPE-Toolbox) (incomplete)
A set of tools made to make College Physics Experiments easy!
